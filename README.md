# 🏥 Healthtech Appointment Reminder System

A no-code/low-code project built using **Lovable AI** and **Supabase**, designed to help clinics and private doctors efficiently manage patient follow-ups by sending timely appointment reminders via SMS or WhatsApp.

## 💡 Project Overview

- Allowing doctors to **schedule appointments**
- Automatically **sending reminders** to patients
- Storing appointment data in a centralized **Supabase** database

- 🗂️ Supabase integration for storing and retrieving appointments
- ✅ Real-time updates with Supabase policies
